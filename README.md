# 👋 Hi, I'm Laith!

## 🎓 About Me
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Jordan (2020) and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Colorado Boulder (2024). I'm a self-taught individual passionate about experimenting with new ideas and continuously learning from life experiences.

## 🔍 Experience and Passion
I'm a Civil Engineer with a Master’s in Data Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, now specializing in Computer Vision. I apply full data science methodology to real-world problems through hands-on, end-to-end projects. With experience in precast concrete manufacturing (ARTIC) and applied data science in business (Listening247), I'm steadily building toward a long-term goal of leading impactful, data-driven solutions in the future.
